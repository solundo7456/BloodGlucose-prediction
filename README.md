As a Data Scientist deeply passionate about the intersection of AI and healthcare, I developed this project to explore how machine learning can enhance real-world medical insights.
Using LSTM neural networks, I built a model capable of predicting blood glucose levels one hour ahead based on time-series glucose data — a step toward smarter, data-driven diabetes management.

This project pushed me to fine-tune neural architectures, handle physiological time-series data, and optimize model performance for real clinical relevance.

🏆 Best Configuration: (32, 0.2, 0.001, 64, 12)
📊 Performance Highlights:

MSE: 0.0027

MAE: 0.0358

R² Score: 0.8544

The model showed consistent improvement across 30 epochs and was saved as glucose_lstm_best_model.pt.
Through this project, I learned how thoughtful feature engineering and model tuning can bridge the gap between AI and human health.
