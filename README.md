#Predicting Future Blood Glucose Levels with Deep Learning
## BloodGlucose-prediction
Blood Glucose prediction using neural networks

As a Data Scientist passionate about applying AI to real-world healthcare problems. I have worked on this project.
The project focuses on predicting blood glucose levels using a neural network (LSTM) trained on time-series glucose data. The model forecasts glucose one hour ahead with high accuracy.

🏆 Best Configuration: (32, 0.2, 0.001, 64, 12)
📉 Results:

MSE: 0.0027

MAE: 0.0358

R²: 0.8544

The model trained over 30 epochs with consistent loss reduction and was saved as glucose_lstm_best_model.pt.

This project enhanced my skills in deep learning, time-series forecasting, and model optimization contributing to smarter, data-driven diabetes care.
